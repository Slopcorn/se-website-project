        <h1> Trump tweets</h1>
		<ul>
			<p>President Donald Trump has a habit of contradicting himself. More often than not, his tweets feel hypocritical to something he has previously said or supported. In fact, it’s almost too easy to catch Trump in an unnecessary lie or belabored point. As long as you have Twitter handy, you can pull up things he’s tweeted in the middle of the night from his tweet room (i.e. bathroom) and cross reference them with what he’s saying on television. It shouldn’t be that easy to catch our politicians in a lie, but the internet has a knack for pulling up the receipts on 45.</p>
			<li>The billionaire complained about the media’s treatment of him and the criticism of his perceived sexist attitudes to women back in March. In his apology over the 2005 comments this week, he admitted: "Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong and I apologise."</li>
